## ✨ Key Features Explained

### Mock Data System
All data is stored in local state using React Context. Changes persist during the session but reset on page reload. Perfect for demonstration purposes.

### Responsive Design
The application is fully responsive with:
- Mobile-first approach
- Collapsible sidebar on mobile
- Adaptive layouts for all screen sizes

### Status Management
Bookings, complaints, and emergencies follow clear status workflows:
- **Bookings**: Pending → Confirmed → Cancelled/Completed
- **Complaints**: New → In Progress → Resolved
- **Emergencies**: New → Acknowledged → Resolved

### AI Chat Simulation
The chat interface includes keyword-based responses that simulate an AI assistant, routing users to appropriate services.

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

- **Modern Design**: Clean, professional interface suitable for FYP presentation
- **Color-Coded Badges**: Visual status indicators throughout
- **Interactive Charts**: Real-time data visualization in analytics
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions for better UX
- **Alert System**: Urgent notifications for emergencies

## 📝 Mock Data Notes

All mock data is defined in `src/data/mockData.ts` including:
- 6 hotel rooms with varying types and amenities
- Sample bookings with different statuses
- Customer complaints and emergencies
- Staff members with different roles
- Analytics data for charts

## 🔒 Authentication

Mock authentication is implemented using localStorage. Login persists across page refreshes until logout.
